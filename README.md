Coffee App coding excercise

##Required:
- Do all layout using autolayout in code `done`
- Network calls must be done using AFNetworking `done`
- Target iOS 7.1+ `done`
- Install libraries with Cocoapods `done`

##Nice-to-haves:
- Send your api_key as the Authorization HTTP header, not as a GET param `done`
- Use Mantle for object serialization `done`
- Make use of Reactive Cocoa `done`
- Make the app offline usable `done`
 
##Assumptions:
- App only fetches the data once on initial launch and archives the data providing offline usability through persisted data
